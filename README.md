[Educell International School Demo](https://educell-international-school.netlify.com/)


Educell International School challenges us to create a remote and low resource environment app that provides a way for school administrators and social workers to create, read, update, and delete student data.



## MVP

There needs are On boarding, logging in, and viewing a list of all student in the school, with date of past edits/visits. For example: school admins can change e-mail or contact phone number of Student. This change should be recorded. Administrators can delete a student record entirely. This action should be recorded. (as of this writing) Admins cannot change their own password, this feature is TBD. It is assumed that ALL Signups and Log ins are either Educell Administrators or Educell Workers. 

## The `Navigation` Bar
